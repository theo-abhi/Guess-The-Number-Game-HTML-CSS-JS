# Guess-The-Number-Game-HTML-CSS-JS

A classic "Guess the Number" game implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity.

## Overview

This project is a simple and engaging web-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated secret number within a certain range. It provides feedback to the user on whether their guess is too high or too low, guiding them to find the correct number. This is a fun and interactive project built entirely on client-side technologies.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** A secret random number is generated at the start of each game.
- **User Input:** Allows the user to input their guess through a text field.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provides clear feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low.
- **Limited Attempts (Optional):** You might have implemented a limited number of guesses, adding a challenge to the game.
- **Win Condition:** Detects when the user guesses the correct number and displays a congratulatory message.
- **Play Again Functionality:** Allows the user to start a new game with a new random number.
- **Clean and Intuitive Interface:** Designed with HTML and styled with CSS for a user-friendly experience.
- **Client-Side Logic:** Implemented entirely with JavaScript for interactive gameplay directly in the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structural elements of the game interface (input field, buttons, display areas for feedback).
- **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance of the game, making it engaging and easy to read.
